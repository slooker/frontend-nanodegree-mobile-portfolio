### Optimizations Performed ###

Changed the size of most images
Removed variables from the for loops that didn't need to be instantiated inside a loop
Changed the document.querySelectorAll() calls
Changed the number of pizzas that were rendered in the background
Minified javascript and made it async
Minified css (Didn't inline, on purpose)
 
Last evaluation claimed I didn't have higher than a 90 on mobile and frontend, so I included screenshots of both my scores above 90.
